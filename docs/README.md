# overslash

`Overslash` is an utility library as `Underscore` and `Lodash`. However, `Overslash` doesn't pretend to compete with these honorable libraries. `Overslash` implements only a small subset of the functions that can be found in these library.

`Overslash` ambition is quite different. `Overslash` is modular. You can build a version with only the subset of the functions you need.

Then, you can embed it in your own library. So, you can ship your library without any external dependencies.
